SDL2 toolkit for Go examples
============================
This repository contains several examples, ranging from very basic to a little more advanced. It is
meant to showcase the possibilities of
package [`github.com/veandco/go-sdl2`](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) combined
with [`github.com/roeldev/go-sdl2-experiments/pkg/sdlkit`](https://github.com/roeldev/go-sdl2-experiments/pkg/sdlkit).

Some examples are heavily inspired by the works, or contain art or other assets created by others.
These examples contain a notice and location of the original works/assets.
