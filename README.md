Package `sdlkit` contains basic building blocks when using `SDL2` with go. It
uses `github.com/veandco/go-sdl2` at its base and builds upon it. This package
is not a game or physics engine.

```sh
go get github.com/go-pogo/sdlkit
```

```go
import "github.com/go-pogo/sdlkit"
```

## SDL2 installation on Windows

- install a gcc compiler (for example `tdm-gcc`
  from https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/)
- make sure it is added to your PATH environment variable, test this by
  running `gcc -v`
- run `go get -v github.com/veandco/go-sdl2/sdl@master`
- run `go mod vendor` to create/sync vendor directory
- run `git submodule add https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2-libs.git .go-sdl2-libs`
- copy/symlink `.go-sdl2-libs`
  to `vendor/github.com/veandco/go-sdl12/.go-sdl2-libs`
- build/run your project with the `-tags static` build flag
- optionally add the `-v -x` build flags to output the files that are compiled
